# eTour-documentation

Please take a look at eTour Wiki, which introduces eTour and it's architecture:
https://github.com/Beacon-eTour/eTour-documentation/wiki

Also in each repository, you will also find a readme file describing the technical documentation for the specific component and instructions for further development.
