## eTour - Create Tours with Beacons

**eTour provides iOS and Android mobile applications.** These apps can be used to create a tour controlled by a mobile app. User selects a tour and app introduces the target place by directing the user from the beacon to the next. On a tour stop, the beacon launches a dynamic and customized web page and app displays targeted information, images, and videos.

eTour has mobile applications for iOS and Android operating systems. Solution has also NodeJS backend solution, NoSQL database and Redis memory cache. User Interface is developed with Flutter and moth mobile operating systems are using Flutter.

# Architecture

eTour has two mobile applications with iOS and Android operating systems. Backend solution is running in Google Cloud Platform and Firebase NoSQL database stores the tour specific contents. Functional view is presented in figure 1. Sequence diagram of the beacon discovery in action is presented in figure 2.
